# tv.hazy.su

my solution for a youtube client. work in progress!

## setup

- clone the repo
- create a config file (use ``config.json.example`` as a reference)
- in a terminal, run ``npm i`` to install dependencies
- run ``node index.js`` to start the program.
The repo port is defined by the ``config.json`` unless an environment variable named "PORT" exists, meaning heroku works with no changes.



## future things
###### in no particular order

- improve video proxying
- list youtube comments (?)
